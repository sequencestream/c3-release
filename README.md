# c3

**c3 (Code Creative Center)** is a coding platform that fuses harness and loop
engineering with AI software-engineering practice. Instead of throwing a raw prompt at a
model and hoping for the best, c3 turns vague, half-formed requirements into structured
intents — each with a clear scope, explicit dependencies, and a verifiable definition of done.

## Features

- **Structured intents** — vague requirements become scoped, dependency-aware tasks with a verifiable definition of done.
- **Automated loops** — planning, implementation, and validation run as repeatable, auditable flows.
- **Multi-agent discussions** — perspectives converge before code is written.
- **Consensus voting** — multi-agent approval gates before critical decisions.
- **Worktree isolation** — parallel tasks run in isolated git worktrees.
- **Sandbox execution** — untrusted code runs in sandboxed environments.
- **Circuit breaker** — automatic token rate limiting and recovery for agents.
- **Scheduled tasks** — long-running and recurring work keeps moving on its own.
- **SDD-native supported** — spec-driven development as a first-class workflow.

## Prerequisites

Optional tools:
- **GitHub CLI** — `brew install gh`, or see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/).
- **GitLab CLI** — `brew install glab`, or see [gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli).

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install sequencestream/tap/c3
```

### Install script

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequencestream/c3/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequencestream/c3/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The script always fetches the latest release for your platform, verifies its checksum, and installs `c3` (to `~/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\c3\bin` on Windows). Set `C3_INSTALL_DIR` to choose a different location, or `C3_VERSION` to pin a specific version.

### Manual download

Grab the latest build for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/sequencestream/c3/releases/) and extract it:

```bash
# e.g. c3-v0.8.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf c3-v0.8.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz
```

> **macOS note:** the first launch may trigger a security warning. Allow c3 to run in *System Settings → Privacy & Security*.

## Upgrade

### Built-in upgrade command

```bash
c3 upgrade
```

The `upgrade` command downloads the latest release, verifies its signature, and replaces the current binary. It never restarts a running c3 — after upgrading, run `c3 restart` (or exit and rerun) to load the new version.

Options:
- `--check` — only compare versions, do not download or replace.
- `--force` — reinstall the same version (does not downgrade).

### Other upgrade methods

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew upgrade c3
```

**Install script:**

Re-run the install script — it always fetches the latest release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequencestream/c3/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Usage

Start c3 on port 9000:

```bash
# Installed via Homebrew or the install script (c3 is on your PATH)
c3 --port 9000

# Or, from a manual download (run the extracted binary directly)
./c3 --port 9000
```

Then open http://localhost:9000 in your browser. (`c3 --port 9000` is shorthand for `c3 start --port 9000`.)

### Run in the background

Add `--daemon` to detach from the terminal and keep c3 running in the background:

```bash
c3 --port 9000 --daemon
```

### Install as a service

Register c3 as a per-user OS service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, schtasks on Windows) so it starts automatically and stays running:

```bash
c3 install --port 9000
```

The port and workspace are baked into the service unit. Run `c3 install --help` for the full set of options.
